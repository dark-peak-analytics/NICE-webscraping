The overall objective for this project to sustain a living document for recording the software used in the evidence submission for NICE technology appraisals (TAs). The motivation is to monitor trends in use of Excel spreadsheet versus code-based models in the development of submission evidence.

The live document can be viewed here: https://dark-peak-analytics.github.io/NICE-webscraping/
